		<h3>Chevy SSR: A Brief History</h3><br>
		
		<p>
			<img src="images/ssrconcept.jpg" alt="SSR Concept Car" class="img-fluid float-end px-4" width="500" height="400">
			
			The Chevy SSR had a humble beginning compared to the classic it has become. 
			The Chevrolet SSR (Super Sport Roadster) was manufactured from 2003 to 2006. It was developed 
			during the time when many auto manufacturers had begun introducing “retro” designs of popular 
			cars from some of their golden days. <br><br>
			The Chevy SSR took its styling ques from Chevrolet’s late 1940’s pickup truck designs, in particular 
			1947-1955. From the look of the truck, it is obvious that the pronounced fender flairs and grill 
			designs are a direct style feature borrowed from the older generation trucks. The body of the SSR, 
			mainly the fenders, had to be made with techniques that had not been used in body panel stampings for 
			decades. <br><br>
			In 2000, at the Detroit Auto Show, the concept car for the SSR was debuted and known as the SuperSport 
			Roadster concept car. The concept car drew lots of attention with its unique retro design and features 
			like the retractable hardtop roof and 6.0 powertrain. <br><br>
			During the first year of production (2003) Chevrolet released the SSR with some slight design changes 
			from the concept, as well as using the less powerful 5.3 LS truck motor. This decision was not 
			received all to well by the public. Along with the nearly $42 thousand dollar price tag and 4700 lb. 
			curb weight, the futuristic looking truck didn’t quite perform as well as its concept version 
			alluded to. In 2003, General Motors was only able to produce roughly 2500 of the SSR’s with nearly 5,000 more 
			being built in late 2003 but marketed as the 2004-year model. <br><br>
			General Motors listened to their customers feedback and for the 2005 and 2006 model years they 
			ditched the under powered 5.3 LS and opted for the Corvette’s 6.0 LS2, albeit an under tuned version. 
			However, during the short production run only 24,150 were produced. They all shared the same 
			luxury amenities as standard equipment options with little to no changes to exterior or interior 
			designs. <br><br>
			Due to the high cost, limited production numbers, and seemingly cheap interior materials used in all 
			General Motor vehicles, the SSR was discontinued after 2006. Some would say the early 2000’s retro craze was a 
			swing and a miss by most auto makers. Yet the Chevy SSR has found a special place in the hearts of auto 
			enthusiasts. If you talk to anyone who owns or has owned the SSR, they will undoubtedly share the 
			stories of enjoyment.
